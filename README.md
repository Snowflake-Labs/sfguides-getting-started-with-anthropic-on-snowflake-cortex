# Getting Started with ❄️ Anthropic on Snowflake Cortex

## Overview
In this guide, you'll learn how to build an RAG-based (Retrieval Augmented Generation)  application that creates an intelligent assistant for documents and other text-based knowledge. The application uses Anthropic's Claude Large Language Model (LLM),  in [Snowflake's Cortex AI](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/cortex/) alongside Cortex Search and Streamlit. The application addresses end-to-end RAG development to show how to do PDF processing, vector embeddings, retrieval and generation all inside Snowflake to enable natural language interactions with your documents through Claude's advanced language understanding capabilities all with unified governance across the application full-stack.
